# Title of Dataset:
Understanding Pollinator Generalism in Terms of Spatial Heterogenity
---

Here you'll find everything you need to replicate the analyses performed in our study. 
We provided the full concatenated FASTA file used to generate the native north american orchid phylogeny, the orchid and pollinator distribution data, and bioclimatic/range variables. We provided the R code used to calculate Turnover Importance, explore missing data, perform ancestral character estimations, and our real world case studies.


## Description of the Data and file structure

The data is structured mostly in the order in which it was calculated/created. Some names in the scripts might be slightly different from the names in the files, but finding the matches will be pretty easy! 





## Sharing/access Information

All sequence data was derived from genBank. Distribution data was collected from GBIF, and bioclimatic variables were collected from WorldCLim.
